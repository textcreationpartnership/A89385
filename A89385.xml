            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A MOTION Humbly preſented to the High Court of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FIrſt, whether that ſuch Biſhops as ours be, ought to govern the Church, according to the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of the primitive Church, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their calling be truly <hi>Iure Divino:</hi> ſo that in no caſe it ought to be removed, but muſt of neceſſity abide in the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for ever?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether ſuch an <hi>Inſtitution</hi> to be <hi>Iure divino,</hi> not being poſſible to be proved, and thoſe Biſhops vvho have governed our church, have (eſpecially of late) bin a ſcandall to the church, &amp; dealt deceitfully vvith us, and are become ſo odious to all Proteſtant Churches; as they have bin, and novv are, it be not a great ſcandall to our <hi>Church</hi> vvhilſt they governe it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether (all reformed Churches elſe-where, ſo far as they could, having caſt out their Biſhops as an <hi>Antichriſtian government</hi>) our <hi>Church</hi> vvill not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine unreformed in the greateſt matter, whilſt that function doth remaine amongſt us.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Whether that government by Biſhops (firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Papiſts, as lineally diſcending from the Pope, and by papiſts ſtill by Arguments ſo maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) be not a great heartning, and encouragement to all Papiſts, giving them ſtill hopes of bringing in popery by vvorking vvith them; for vvhat better or
<pb facs="tcp:125441:3"/>eaſier way can they have to bring in, or to encreaſe Popery, as experience hath abundantly ſhewed, then Agents for the Romiſh faction, being in every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of this Kingdome: there is no more to bee done, but onely to prevaile with the Prelate thereof, who for the moſt part not onely are too ready to hearken to any project for reward, but are too much in love with the entertaining of popery: have not many good Miniſters bin very painfull in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings before, but after they have bin made Biſhops have bin great Arminians, if not entire Papiſts? May not the Prelate of Canterbury be a preſident herein, in ſome reſpects, with many more hopefull Miniſters firſt, but after the ſuperſtitious conſecration of them (as they call it) to be Biſhops have bin notoriouſly impious, wicked, and popiſhly affected.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Whether their abiding, being onely by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the King and Parliament; it being ſo that they who cry out moſt againſt them are the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt proteſtants, and ſuch who labour for reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for no private end, but labour for ſuch a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as comes neareſt to the preſcript of the Goſpell of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and for that pray oft. Whether it would not be a great griefe, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them, in caſe that the Biſhops ſhould not be removed?</p>
            <p n="9">9 Whether it be not a great Argument to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the removeall of our Biſhops government, it being ſo that thoſe who ſeeke the ſame are ſuch, who are not onely of godly and honeſt life, and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but are ſuch, for the moſt part, as are ready with their goods, liberties, honors, yea their lives to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the honour of the King?</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb facs="tcp:125441:3"/>
7 Whether many of thoſe who labour for their continuance ſtill in the government of the church, be ſuch who doe it out of Chriſtianity, or any love either to the King, or whether for the moſt part they be not men of an evill life, and converſation, or evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected towards the Kings Majeſty, or towards his Majeſties liege people, or have not ſome relation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards popery, or towards popiſhly affected peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or at the leaſt, are familiarly the companions of the Prelats, or their Adherents, or receive ſome way or other profit by them?</p>
            <p n="8">8 Whether in ſuch petitions as have bin put up againſt the Biſhops, there hath bin any ſuch under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand dealing in the getting of hands, as there hath in thoſe petitions, or many of them, that have been put into the houſe for them?</p>
            <p n="9">9 Whether in caſe they ſhould paſſe over all theſe brunts and exclamations, under which they now lye, and ſhould ſtill abide and govern the church. It wold not be then of dangerous conſequence, and embolden them ever hereafter to attempt any thing what they pleaſe, and for ought we know ere long, fall upon popery with great dexterity, and if poſſible, ingroſſe ſuch a power into their hands, as will hardly ever permit them to be curbed againe?</p>
            <p n="10">10 Whether in caſe they ſhould be eſtabliſhed by this great Parliament, they who before did aſſume ſuch power, and play ſuch tyrannous parts, and were ſo great a burden to the godly and faithfull proteſtants, would not now, in caſe they ſhould be eſtabliſhed by this great Aſſembly, whether they would not be more cruell then ever they were, and the Church of England be then under a greater bondage and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, then ever it was before, ſince O.

            <p n="11">
               <pb facs="tcp:125441:4"/>
11 Whether they have not ever bin in all places of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> the greateſt enemies to the Country where they have lived, of any Subjects, and for the moſt part, the only and ſole movers, and cauſers both of forraine dangers, and domeſticke Calamities?</p>
            <p n="12">12. Whether they have not bin a great hinderance to the flouriſhing of the Goſpell in all parts &amp; pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where they have governed, as not onely forraine parts, but our own land can teſtifie: where have wee one <hi>Prelate</hi> in this land, that would labour to ſet up preaching, where it was wanting in his <hi>Dioceſes:</hi> tho moved in it, &amp; for it: no, they thought there was too much preaching already. Surely, did not our <hi>Prelats</hi> feare rather that in caſe the people ſhould be well acquainted with Gods word, they would bee plainly diſcerned to be of an <hi>Antichriſtian government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13 Whether for them ſtill to abide, be not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Kings Majeſty, to the Queen, or towards their hopefull children: there being in ſo many Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, ſo many Relations of moſt dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof to Princes: that when they have bin about a Prince, &amp; have bin curbed, or could not have their will: then have the <hi>Prelats</hi> turned traytors, and bloudy-minded: then have they laboured by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſhifts to murder their Prince, as divers ſtories both of our owne, and other can teſtifie abundantly: whether therefore for his Majeſties ſafety they ought not to be removed, eſpecially, at this <hi>Parliamentarie Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14 Whether a <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſbyteriall government</hi> doth not come nearer to the practice of the primitive church in the Apoſtles times, then the government of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:125441:4"/>15. Whether the Biſhops in <hi>Scotland</hi> being removed, and a <hi>Presbiteriall government</hi> eſtabliſhed: in which <hi>government,</hi> where ere it hath bin eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed hath bin no ſuch ſcandals or blemiſhes, as have continually bin amongſt the Biſhops? whether it be not more probable that it will be more happy for us to be ſo governed in <hi>England</hi> alſo, both Kingdomes being wholly governed by one, &amp; the ſame, our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious King?</p>
            <p n="16">16. Whether in caſe our Biſhops ſhould ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, theirs being removed: it may not become of evill conſequence, either to us, or them, one Religion being eſtabliſhed under one King in one &amp; the ſame <hi>Iland</hi> by divers <hi>Government, and Diſcipline:</hi> which being divers one muſt needs goe beyond, and before the other?</p>
            <p n="17">17. Whether in caſe their's being reformed, &amp; ours not, <hi>divers of our brethren of England will not remove thither,</hi> if not to ſome other parts, &amp; ſo enrich them: but make our owne Kingdome to be the poorer?</p>
            <p n="18">18. Whether they have not in <hi>Scotland</hi> attained to a better and more probable way to root out popery by their <hi>Presbyteriall Government,</hi> then ever wee are likely to doe by the <hi>Prelates?</hi>
